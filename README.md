  Hey, welcome to the first question!

  Here's a breakdown of the question, and some pointers on how to get started!
    - A variable has been declared a few lines above (`numSales`).
    - Just below, the contents of the `numSales` variable are logged to the console.
    - Your job is to assign the variable to the correct value (in this case: the total number of sales) *BEFORE* it is logged out.
    - You can do this by:
      - Adding an `=` sign (we are *assigning* something after all)
      - Starting with the `transactions` variable (see the example question);
      - Adding one or more methods to transform/extract the value we're looking for.
      - If your solution is correct, `numSales` should be equal to 5.

  You can solve the remaining questions in the same way!

  P.S.
  The breakdown above takes up a lot of space, feel free to move it to the top or bottom of the file!
